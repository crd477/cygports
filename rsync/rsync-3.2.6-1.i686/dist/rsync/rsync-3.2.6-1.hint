sdesc: "Fast incremental file transfer program"
ldesc: "Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying
tool. It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell,
or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options
that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for its
delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the
network by sending only the differences between the source files and the
existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used for backups and
mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check"
algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or
in last-modified time. Any changes in the other preserved attributes (as
requested by options) are made on the destination file directly when the
quick check indicates that the file's data does not need to be updated."
